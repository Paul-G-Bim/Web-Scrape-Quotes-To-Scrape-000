The Golden Rules (Ethics)

Before writing code, you must understand the etiquette. Breaking these can get your IP address banned.

1. Check robots.txt: Always check website.com/robots.txt. It tells you which parts of the site bots are allowed to access.

2. Don't Hammer the Server: If you make 100 requests in 1 second, you look like a DDoS attack. Always add a time delay between requests.

3. Identify Yourself: It is good practice to include a "User-Agent" string so the site knows you are a script, not a malicious bot.
